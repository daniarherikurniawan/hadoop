BUILDING HADOOP + UCARE SE

For initial build, go to the root code directory and do:

  git fetch origin
  git checkout ucare_se
  mvn clean
  mvn install package -Pdist -DskipTests

This full build is required only once. Once we have full build of
Hadoop PBSE, we can start making changes and do compilation per
module/project (ie., hadoop-mapreduce-project, hadoop-hdfs-project)



BUILDING PER MODULE

For fast hacking, we don't want to do full build everytime we done
implementing some modification. Therefore, I made custom script called
'packsend' under modules that I modified heavily. You can find couple
of this scripts by executing this command from the code root
directory:

find . -name packsend

The packsend script essentially will do compilation and packaging per
module, instead of full build, and send the modified jars to hadoop
directory in emulab, overwriting the last version (be careful to make
backup if necessary!). Go to the spesific module directory and run
this script to build and send the modified jar.

In order to do per module build, make sure you have install the jars
from initial full build by calling 'mvn install' in previous steps.
